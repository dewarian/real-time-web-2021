# Basic Chat app

For school documentation please navigate to the [docs branch](https://github.com/dewarian/real-time-web-2021/tree/docs)

This project is intended to be a better version of WhatsApp. The reason for this is because the web app and the desktop client are incredibly annoying to use.

Thus I would like to add Telegram functionalities and more.

## Future functionalities

- [ ] Normal Giphy setup
- [ ] Markdown text support
  - With this I would like to setup bold, italic and possibly code mark-up
- [ ] Replying to messages
- [ ] Profile page
  - With login / settings
- [ ] Media sharing
- [ ] Custom actions
  - Imagine WhatsApp business or `/` functionality.

# External Data

The first API I was thinking of is the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/sdk#design-guidelines).
